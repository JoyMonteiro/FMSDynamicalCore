Step 1:
=======
* take Makefile in exec.ia64 folder and move it to its own folder.
* copy src/ directory to this folder
* change SRCROOT in Makefile to ./src/

Step 2:
=======
* Copy all env variables from ia64 template to Makefil directory so that 
  we don't have to include it
* Change src/atmos_solo/atmos_model.f90, where the main program exists.
  edit `program atmos_model` to `module atmos_model` so that there is no
  executable.
* Add -fPIC to FFLAGS in Makefile so that code can go into a library.

* Surround the executable part of the program with a subroutine `run_this_model`,
  move the `contains` statement to above this subroutine, and move all data declarations
  to above the `contains` statement.

* Change the last line of the Makefile, which compiles the program into a command which
  creates a static library (ar rcs library.a <object files>).
